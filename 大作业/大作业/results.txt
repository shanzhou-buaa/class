50286 James's eyes were hazel, his nose was slightly longer than Harry's and there was no scar on his forehead, but they had the same thin face, same mouth, same eyebrows; James's hair stuck up at the back exactly as Harry's did, his hands could have been Harry's and Harry could tell that, when James stood up, they would be within an inch of each other in height.
48188 I didn't practise, I didn't bother, I could've stopped myself having those dreams, Hermione kept telling me to do it, if I had he'd never have been able to show me where to go, and-Sirius wouldn't-Sirius wouldn't-'Something was erupting inside Harry's head: a need to justify himself, to explain-I tried to check he'd really taken Sirius, I went to Umbridge's office, I spoke to Kreacher in the fire and he said Sirius wasn't there, he said he'd gone!
39986 Little Ginny's been writing in it for months and months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes - how her brothers tease her, how she had to come to school with secondhand robes and books, how - Riddle's eyes glinted - how she didn't think famous, good, great Harry Potter would ever like herAll the time he spoke, Riddle's eyes never left Harry's face.
39455 I mean, it was really great of you and everything,' said Hermione quickly, looking positively petrified at the look on Harry's face, everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do-'That's funny,' said Harry through gritted teeth, because I definitely remember Ron saying I'd wasted time acting the hero .
39438 Harry, Ginny and Neville and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish: for a moment it seemed suspended in midair, then it soared towards Ron, spinning as it came, and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it, unravelling like rolls of film-Ha ha ha, Harry, look at it-' said Ron, watching it disgorge its gaudy innards, Harry, come and touch it; bet it's weird-'RON, NO!
39142 It's just a cut -it's nothing-it's-'But Ron had grabbed Harry's forearm and pulled the back of Harry's hand up level with his eyes.
38012 Harry could not see why: the hall was quite empty but for themselves, the sobbing Bellatrix still trapped under the witch statue, and the baby phoenix Fawkes croaking feebly on the floor-'Then Harry's scar burst open and he knew he was dead: it was pain beyond imagining, pain past endurance-He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the creatures began: they were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no escape-And when the creature spoke, it used Harry's mouth, so that in his agony he felt his jaw move .
37731 It's been hurting on and off all summer-it was just a bit worse tonight, that's all-'Harry, I'm sure Dumbledore would want to be bothered by this-' Yeah,' said Harry, before he could stop himself, that's the only bit of me Dumbledore cares about, isn't it, my scar?
37499 The whole time you're sure you know there's nothing between you and dying except your own-your own brain or guts or whatever-like you can think straight when you know you're about a nanosecond from being murdered, or tortured, or watching your friends die- they've never taught us that in their classes, what it's like to deal with things like that-and you two sit there acting like I'm a clever little boy to be standing here, alive, like Diggory was stupid, like he messed up-you just don't get it, that could just as easily have been me, it would have been if Voldemort hadn't needed me-'We weren't saying anything like that, mate,' said Ron, looking aghast.
37274 'See, I wouldn't ave left,' said Mundungus, leaning forward, a pleading note in his voice, but I ad a business opportunity-'Harry felt something brush against his knees and started, but it was only Crookshanks, Hermione's bandy-legged ginger cat, who wound himself once around Harry's legs, purring, then jumped on to Sirius's lap and curled up.
35490 First came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry's stomach did a back-flip) Cho and one of her usually-giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and looking so dreamy she might have walked in by accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait clown her back whose name Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner and Terry Boot, Ginny, closely followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom Harry recognised vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team and, bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko's merchandise.
35309 You hold Ginny's other hand-Harry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt, Ron took hold of the back of Harry's robes, and Harry reached out and took hold of Fawkes's strangely hot tail feathers.
34605 Harry knew he shouldn't have risen to Dudley's bait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had been thinking himself maybe he didn't have any friends at HogwartsWish they could see famous Harry Potter now , he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running down his face.
34598 Luna said vaguely that she did not know how soon Rita's interview with Harry would appear in The Quibbler, that her father was expecting a lovely long article on recent sightings of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks, -and of course, that'll be a very important story, so Harry's might have to wait for the following issue,' said Luna.
34371 ' he muttered, but Ron shook his head, and Hermione said quietly, We knew you'd be angry, Harry, we really don't blame you, but you've got to understand, we did try to persuade Dumbledore-'Yeah, I know,' said Harry grudgingly.
34355 I'm the one Voldemort's trying to use, that's why they've got guards around me everywhere I go, it's not for my protection, it's for other people's, only it's not working, they can't have someone on me all the time at Hogwarts .
34268 You're too-' Harry began, but Ginny said fiercely, I'm three years older than you were when you fought You-Know-Who over the Philosophers Stone, and it's because of me that Malfoy's stuck back in Umbridge's office with giant flying bogies attacking him-'Yeah, but-'We were all in the DA together,' said Neville quietly.
34207 'Hagrid,' said Hermione breathlessly, skirting the patch of nettles they had passed on their way there, if the centaurs don't want humans in the Forest, it doesn't really look as though Harry and I will be able-'Ah, you heard what they said,' said Hagrid dismissively, they wouldn't hurt foals-I mean, kids.
34158 If you could hear him when he thinks no one's listening, oh, he's always talking about the goblins he's had done in; he's had them drowned, he's had them dropped off buildings, he's had them poisoned, he's had them cooked in pies.
33637 It was over in two breathless, desperate, windswept seconds-Harry's fingers closed around the tiny, struggling ball-Malfoy's fingernails scrabbled the back of Harry's hand hopelessly-Harry pulled his broom upwards, holding the struggling ball in his hand and the Gryffindor spectators screamed their approval .
